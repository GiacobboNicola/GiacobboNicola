# Hi, I'm [N]icola 👋

🪧 Welcome to my little corner of the internet❗.

I am... :thinking: what I am:question:

Well, my degree says I'm an astronomer 🔭, but I used to see myself more as an astrophysicist ⌨️ (yeah, they're not the same thing :astonished:). 
After a couple of postdocs I quit academia, but I keep loving (astro)science, and I redirected my energies to study another kind of universe... 🌌 -> 🖥️. 

Here you can find some projects I work(ed) on.
